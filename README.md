A Flask-based microservice designed to send email notifications and schedule reminders for students. This service supports immediate email dispatch, scheduled reminders with Indian Standard Time (IST) support, and includes a user-friendly offline page when the server is down.

## Features
- Send immediate email notifications to students.
- Schedule reminder emails with customizable dates and times (supports IST).
- Displays a custom offline page with simple instructions when the server is unavailable.
- Built with Flask, Python, SMTP (Gmail), and Service Workers for offline support.

## Prerequisites
- **Docker**: For running the service in a containerized environment.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Internet Connection**: Required for email sending via SMTP.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the Student Notification Service on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Malleshappa-Patil/student-notification-service.git
   cd student-notification-service

2. **Build and Run with Docker**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    This will start the service and make it available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

3. **Configuration**:
    ```bash
    Update the SMTP credentials in app.py (e.g., SMTP_USERNAME and SMTP_PASSWORD) with your Gmail account details or an app-specific password if 2FA is enabled.
    Ensure your Gmail account allows "less secure apps" or use an app-specific password.


**Usage**
    ```bash
    1. Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000.
    2. Fill out the form with:

    3. Click "Send Notification" to send an immediate email and/or schedule a reminder.
    4. The service checks for reminders every minute. Ensure the server remains running for reminders to be sent.


**Offline Mode**

    If the server is down, a friendly message will appear: "Oops! Service is Down". Simply try again later or restart the server if youâ€™re the administrator.
